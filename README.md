# Litty Youtube Player/Playlist

 This Unity project is a Youtube video player and playlist, controlled in Twitch chat. This project
 goes around all the obstacles of needing bloated 3rd party libraries.

The things you do need:
- A Youtube API Key. You can create one from the [Youtube Development Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) under APIs & Services
- Twitch ClientID and Access Token. You can get those from [Twitch Token Generator](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/)

Replace Youtube API key in PlaylistManager.cs, and replace Twitch credentials in Twitch.cs
